## LF2 Function & AI Injector
This is just a modification from [LF2-AI-ScriptEngine](https://github.com/zort/lf2-ai-scriptengine). <br/>
Instead of just to inject an AI to Little Fighter 2(LF2), this's also meant to inject a function to LF2. <br/>
A friendly way to modify LF2, instead messing up with `HEX`, this one messing up from `C++`.

Dunno if this one can be better than directly modifying from `HEX`.
But in fact, this way is much friendlier.
But yes, `HEX` has it's own favor.

## Modifying
To start modifying, you'll need [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), 2019 or higher. <br/>
(Open `ddwrapper.sln`.) <br/>

Inside the project, you'll see `ddwrapper.cpp`, it's the core of the `ddraw.dll`. <br/>
Better to reformat the code to get better look if you didn't like my formatting style. <br/>
My changes from the orginial `ddraw.dll` was in `//External Code`.
